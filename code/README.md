# To replicate all of the analyses in our manuscript:  

<b>First, unzip the following files, and remove the original `.zip` files:</b>
+ path
+ path

<b>Second, run the code in each of this directory's jupyter notebooks, in numerical order:</b>

+ 1_compile_data.ipynb
+ 2_preprocess_data.ipynb
+ 3_analyze_data.ipynb

<hr>

Beware that compiling the data from scratch can take a long time! If you'd rather just skip to the main analyses, simply unzip the files `behavioral.zip` and `d_nov_b.zip`, then run the code in `3_analyze_data.ipynb`
